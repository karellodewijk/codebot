Cbot 
****

Cbot is short for codebot, an interactive programming enviroment in irc. 
 
It supports 5 languages ruby, python, java, c++ and c.
 
It can work in different modes for each of these languages. 
    - In snippet mode, a number of useful files are allready imported and you are dropped right into the main function.
    - In program mode you have write a full program yourself.
    - Ruby and python also support interactive mode, which gives quick feedback on every command, like the irb and python console respectively
 
Quickstart
----------

You start by saying cbot new language mode, to get into your programming enviroment. From this point
cbot will assume everything you say until you pause or stop cbot is code. 
 
In interactive mode your code will yield immediate results but in the other modes, after you arere satisfied
with your code you need to say cbot r, to actually run it.
 
Other useful commands are
    cbot p                  lists your progress
    cbot delete line        deletes a line
    cbot edit line          edit a line
    cbot insert index line  insert a line at the given index
    cbot pause              pause entering code
    cbot continue           pause entering code
    cbot stop               stop entering code, all progress wil be lost
 

list of commands
----------------

All commands must be prefixed by cbot. parameters between () are optional. | signifies or. 
 
new|n (ruby|python|java|c|c++) (i|s|p)      Start program enviroment in interactive|snippet|program mode
stop|s                                      Stop program enviroment, progress will be lost
run|r                                       Run program or snippet
delete|d|undo|u (nothing|line|start stop)   Delete last line|given line|range
add|a user                                  Add another user to your programming enviroment
pause|wait|w                                Stop adding lines but do not stop programming enviroment
continue|cont|c                             Continue when paused
print|progress|p (nothing|line|start stop)  Print all|line|range
edit|e|change index newline                 Changes line index with newline
insert|i index newline                      Inserts the newline at the specified position


Notes
-----

- Java is always compiles in the file Test.java, so your main class must also be called Test
- In ruby and python snippet and program mode are the same.
- In snippet mode the line numbers in the error messages will not always be accurate
